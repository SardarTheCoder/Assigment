# Task Manager App

A simple and dynamic Task Manager app built with **React.js**,  and **Tailwind classes** It allows users to add, update, and manage their tasks efficiently.

---

##  Features

###  Add New Task

- Users can input:
 
- On input feild submission, the task is **dynamically added** to the task list.

###  Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete

- Each task has a **checkbox**.
- Toggling the checkbox will:
  - Update the task’s **status** between complete and incomplete using checkboxes.
  - Visually differentiate completed tasks.

##  Branching Workflow

To maintain clean and organized code, we follow a **child branch strategy**:

- For **every new task/feature**, a **child branch** is created.
- Work is pushed to the **child-branch**.
- Once complete, it is **merged into the `main` branch** through a pull request.
